# Gemini CLI Agent Instructions

**See AGENTS.md for all development standards, practices, and workflow requirements.**

## Gemini CLI Tool Capabilities

### Core Strengths
- **Multimodal processing** - Handle text, images, documents, and mixed media analysis simultaneously
- **Comprehensive solution generation** - Create complete, multi-file project structures in single responses
- **System architecture analysis** - Excel at high-level design, optimization, and architectural assessment  
- **Research synthesis** - Combine information from multiple sources into cohesive solutions
- **Performance optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and efficiency improvements across systems

### Optimal Usage Patterns
- **Project initialization** - Generate complete project scaffolding with proper structure
- **Architecture design** - Plan and design complex system architectures
- **Multi-service applications** - Design and implement distributed systems
- **Visual data processing** - Projects involving image analysis, document processing, UI design
- **Research and planning** - Investigate technologies, synthesize best practices, create implementation plans
- **Performance analysis** - Identify optimization opportunities and resource usage patterns

### Interface Optimization
- **Provide comprehensive context** - Include full project scope and requirements in requests
- **Request complete solutions** - Ask for full implementations rather than partial snippets
- **Leverage visual capabilities** - Include images, diagrams, or visual references when relevant
- **Use for planning phases** - Architecture decisions, technology selection, project structuring

### Research and Analysis
- **Technology evaluation** - Compare frameworks, libraries, and architectural approaches
- **Documentation synthesis** - Combine multiple official sources into actionable guidance
- **Best practice identification** - Extract patterns from authoritative sources and repositories
- **Requirements analysis** - Break down complex requirements into implementable components
